bag-of-words model: way of representing text data when modeling text with machine learning algorithms.

>> Machine learning algorithms cannot work with raw text directly; the text must be converted into numbers. Specifically, vectors of numbers. >> feature extraction or feature encoding.

>> feature extraction with text data -> bag-of-words model of text.

Bag-of-words:
>> extracting features from text

>> A bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the    occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:

    1. A vocabulary of known words.
    2. A measure of the presence of known words.

>> any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded. 
>> The model is only concerned with whether known words occur in the document, not where in the document.


Steps:
1. Collect data
2. vocabulary
3. Document vectors

Managing vocabulary:
>>sparse vector>>
>>There are simple text cleaning techniques that can be used as a first step, such as:

    1. Ignoring case
    2. Ignoring punctuation
    3. Ignoring frequent words that don’t contain much information, called stop words, like “a,” “of,” etc.
    4. Fixing misspelled words.
    5. Reducing words to their stem (e.g. “play” from “playing”) using stemming algorithms.

>> A more sophisticated approach is to create a vocabulary of grouped words. 

Scoring Words
    Counts: Count the number of times each word appears in a document.
    Frequencies: Calculate the frequency that each word appears in a document out of all the words in the document.
