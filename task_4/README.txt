1. Linear regression vs Logistic regression. Model?
2. Importance of batch size while training.
3. What is cross entropy? Accuracy vs Loss function. 
4. Importance of hidden layer. Deep Neural Network.
    a. Practical:Train the same model of Part 1 with one hidden layer.Document the performance improvement on using this layer.
5. Training a model? 
6. Necessity of GPU in training. Device parameter?                  
    Practical:Compare the training times on a CPU vs. GPU
