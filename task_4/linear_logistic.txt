Linear regression:
-statistical method => modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
-continuous dependent variable
-continuous or categorical independent variables
-assume : relationship => linear
        : errors are normally distributed and have constant variance
-goal: estimate the coefficients of the independent variables that best predict the dependent variable.

Logistic regression:
-statistical method => modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
-binary dependent variable (0 or 1)
-continuous or categorical independent variables
-estimates the probability of the dependent variable being 1 given the independent variables
-used to transform the linear combination of the independent variables into a probability score between 0 and 1.
-assumes : relationship => nonlinear
         : errors are binomially distributed  


In summary, linear regression is used for continuous dependent variables, while logistic regression is used for binary dependent variables. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables, while logistic regression assumes a nonlinear relationship.
