The typing.Protocol module in the Python Standard Library provides a way to define and enforce protocols in Python.

The Protocol class from the typing module is a generic class that can be used as a base class for defining a protocol. When you inherit from Protocol, you specify the methods and attributes that are required for a class to fulfill the protocol. A class that inherits from a protocol is required to provide an implementation for all the methods and attributes specified in the protocol.

Here's an example of using the Protocol class to define a protocol for a serializable object:

python
Copy code
from typing import Protocol

class Serializable(Protocol):
    def serialize(self) -> str:
        pass
    
    @classmethod
    def deserialize(cls, data: str) -> 'Serializable':
        pass
        
In this example, the Serializable class is a protocol that defines two methods: serialize and deserialize. A class that wants to implement this protocol must provide an implementation for these two methods. The Protocol class enforces this requirement at runtime, so if a class claims to implement the Serializable protocol but does not provide an implementation for the required methods, a TypeError will be raised.

The typing.Protocol module provides a way to define and enforce protocols in a more flexible and powerful way than traditional interface definitions in Python. It is a useful tool for creating reusable, composable components in your code, and for ensuring that classes meet specific requirements.
