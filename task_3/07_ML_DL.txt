Machine Learning (ML):
ML is turning things(data) into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers.

Deep Learning (DL):
DL model are designed to automatically learn hiearchical representationn of data.
eg: image classification, NLP, speech recognisation

==========================================================

Traditional Program:
Input, Rules => Output

ML algorithms:
Input, Output => Rules
(Input: Features; Output: Liables, supervised learning)

===========================================================

When ML/DL?
1. Problem with long list of rules.
2. Continuously chamging environments.
3. Discovering insights within large ollection of data

===========================================================

ML v/s DL:

Generally, ML => structured data
           DL => unstructured data (images, audio, text)

Algorithms:
            ML          |       DL
-Random forest          | -Neural Networkd
-Gradient Boosted Model | - Fully connected neural networks
-Naive Bayes            | -Convolutional neural networks
-Nearest Neighbour      | -Recurrent neural networks
-Support Vector Machine | -Transformer

the following algorithms can be used for both, depending upon the problem and approach
