Start the notebook server from the command line:
    $jupyter notebook

How do I open a specific Notebook?
The following code should open the given notebook in the currently running notebook server, starting one if necessary.

jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb

How do I start the Notebook using a custom IP or port?
By default, the notebook server starts on port 8888. If port 8888 is unavailable or in use, the notebook server searches the next available port. You may also specify a port manually. In this example, we set the serverâ€™s port to 9999:

jupyter notebook --port 9999
How do I start the Notebook server without opening a browser?
Start notebook server without opening a web browser:

jupyter notebook --no-browser
How do I get help about Notebook server options?
The notebook server provides help messages for other command line arguments using the --help flag:

jupyter notebook --help

Using a command-line interface
Notebooks can be executed from your terminal using the run subcommand. It expects notebook paths as input arguments and accepts optional flags to modify the default behavior.

Running a notebook is this easy.

jupyter run notebook.ipynb
You can pass more than one notebook as well.

jupyter run notebook.ipynb notebook2.ipynb
By default, notebook errors will be raised and printed into the terminal. You can suppress them by passing the --allow-errors flag.

jupyter run notebook.ipynb --allow-errors
