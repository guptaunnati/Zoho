To train a model, we need
=> loss function
=> optimizer

==================================

"epoch" refers to a complete cycle through a dataset during training in machine learning and deep learning models.
Iterations => Epoch

- hyperparameter
(determines the number of times the entire training dataset is presented to the model for learning.)

-Each epoch => accuracy
          => loss

-With every epoch accuracy should increase, loss should decrease
