1. Learn about Pytorch. Install Pytorch. Uses of tools like  Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab.

2. Vector, Matrix, Tensor, Gradient descent, Numpy, Torch, TorchVision.

3. Process of vectorization

4. Linear regression model.

5. Dataset, Weight, Bias. Parameters Vs HyperParameters.

6. Generating prediction using linear regression model.

7. Loss function Vs Cost function.

8. Mean squared error.

9. Forward Vs Backward function.

10. Relationship between gradient descent and weights and biases.

11. Epoch, Benefits of increasing epoch.

12. Learning rate.

13. Optimizer in Pytorch

Practical: Train a model with unstructured data with a minimum of 100 epochs and prove that increasing epoch decreases the loss.
